##Code challenge 35

##Challenge
AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node

AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph

GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

GetNeighbors()
Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph


Node can be successfully added to the graph
An edge can be successfully added to the graph
A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
An empty graph properly returns null
